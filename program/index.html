		    Ensuring your data is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is essential in today's data-driven research environment. This workshop will introduce you to the tools and techniques of Research Data Management (RDM) to manage data and guarantee reproducibility. You will learn the theory and technical implementation of RDM through a combination of expert-led lectures and hands-on lab exercises. It will cover RDM foundations, version control, machine-actionability and data discovery.

After postdoctoral research positions at UBC and the University of Alaska Fairbanks, they joined the Department of Biology at Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2006.

One focus is wildlife microbiology, which includes studying avian influenza viruses and antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli in wild birds.</p>

                        <details class="keynote-details">
                            <summary>Abstract</summary>
                            <p class="abstract">In this presentation I will focus on wild birds and their role in the circulation and dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli. Starting in late 2021, there have been repeated introductions of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses into North America from Eurasia across both the Pacific and Atlantic routes. One introduction was of an H5N5 strain, known as A6, that was first detected in Newfoundland in 2023 and subsequently dispersed throughout Atlantic Canada and into Quebec with a notably high proportion of detected infections in terrestrial mammals. This strain seemed to go largely undetected elsewhere before causing a human fatality in Washington State in November 2025. In addition to viral zoonoses, wildlife are also reservoirs for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. We have used a culture-based approach to isolate antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from wild birds in Newfoundland, followed by phenotypic and genomic characterization of isolated strains. Overall, wild birds in this region were found to be reservoirs of genetically diverse antimicrobial-resistant and potentially pathogenic E. coli. Strains isolated from birds with greater use of anthropogenically affected environments were more diverse, had higher rates of resistance, and were resistant to more compounds than those from birds that use more pristine environments. The studied bird species make significant local and migratory movements and likely serve as important vectors for the dissemination of these bacteria across broad geographic scales.</p>

Fungal diseases impact the lives of millions of people across the globe ranging from superficial to systemic infections. Treatment options toward fungal diseases are limited given the emergence of new pathogens with intrinsic resistance and heightened evolution toward resistant strains. To effectively combat fungal disease, my research team harnesses the cutting-edge power of mass spectrometry-based proteomics integrated with advanced bioinformatics. By identifying protein drivers of fungal disease, we can provide new biological insights across four pillars of research: i) Prevention, ii) Diagnostics, iii) Monitoring, and iv) Treatment. For prevention, we disrupt critical proteins and pathways to weaken the pathogen and prevent infection; for diagnostics, we define dual-perspective protein production signatures—spanning both host and pathogen—across spatial and temporal dimensions to enable precise diagnostic and prognostic insights. For monitoring and treatment, we explore host-pathogen interactions at the protein level, uncovering novel druggable targets essential for therapeutic innovation, and we combat antifungal resistance through protein targeting to restore the efficacy of existing antifungal drugs. Together, our integrated proteomics-driven approach offers transformative solutions to fungal disease management with the goal of advancing global health initiatives.

After 3 years working at Alberta Farm Animal Care, they went on to complete their PhD in Animal Sciences with Paul Stothard at the University of Alberta in which they			    applied multi-omic methods to link changes in diet to changes in gut microbes/metabolites.  This included identifying key functional changes that can mitigate post-weaning diarrhea while reducing use of antimicrobials. Their thesis was awarded the top thesis prize for the University of Alberta's Faculty of Agriculture, Life, and Environmental Sciences. Following this they worked as a Research Program Officer for the Results Driven Agricultural Research provincial funding agency until beginning their faculty position at Dalhousie in mid-2024.
