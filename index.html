    <h2>Welcome to ZAMBI 2026</h2>
    <p>
        The Zoonoses, AMR, and BioInformatics (ZAMBI) meeting brings together researchers, trainees, and professionals working at the intersection of antimicrobial resistance, emerging zoonotic diseases, and computational biology. This conference is a joint effort of three leading One Health research training platforms: <a href="https://canamrnet.org/">CAN-AMR-NET</a>, <a href="https://www.canopytraining.ca/">Canopy</a>, and the <a href="https://bioinformatics.ca/hub/network/atlantic/">Canadian Bioinformatics Hub&rsquo;s Atlantic Node</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our four-day program is designed to foster transdisciplinary collaboration and build a connected community of highly skilled researchers who will work, collaborate, and innovate together. Through research presentations, hands-on workshops, and networking events, ZAMBI 2026 aims to train the next generation of researchers, practitioners, and leaders capable of tackling the complex, interconnected health challenges facing human, animal, and environmental systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Conference Themes</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Evolution:</strong> Phylogenetic, phylodynamic, landscape, and lateral gene-transfer analyses can be integrated to characterize pathogen evolution and transmission across interconnected human, animal, and environmental systems. This computational work underpins One Health approaches by generating actionable evidence for risk assessment and preparedness. Findings directly inform policy decisions and multi-sector systems change, enabling more resilient surveillance architectures, targeted interventions, and cross-disciplinary governance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Environmental Ecology and Microbial Communities:</strong> Field-based environmental sequencing, eDNA, community ecology, and microbiome research characterize how ecological interactions shape health across human, animal, and environmental systems. These insights strengthen One Health approaches by guiding microbiome stewardship, informing environmental and public-health policy, and enabling systems-level changes that improve ecosystem resilience, surveillance, and resource management.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Applied One Health Research:</strong> Applied laboratory and translational research on novel therapeutics, vaccines, and outbreak investigation aims to mitigate risks across interconnected human, animal, and environmental domains. This One Health&ndash;aligned work generates evidence for policy and operational decision-making and incorporates intentional trust-building and policy engagement strategies to enhance impact. By supporting transparent communication, cross-sector collaboration, and the integration of scientific findings into practice, it advances systems-level change in surveillance, governance, and emergency preparedness.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Partner Platforms</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>CAN-AMR-NET</strong> is a national health research training platform focused on antimicrobial use and resistance through a One Health lens. Our goal is to train the next generation of researchers, practitioners, and leaders in the application of transdisciplinary methodologies and communication skills across One Health sectors to tackle the wicked problem of AMR.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Canopy</strong> (Canadian One Health Training Program on Emerging Zoonoses) connects researchers, professionals, and emerging leaders across Canada to tackle health challenges from zoonotic diseases. Canopy is dedicated to training highly competent personnel capable of excellence in health research on emerging zoonoses with a One Health approach, developing a connected community of highly skilled researchers, building sustainable and resilient systems that can better prevent, prepare for, and respond to current and future threats, and fostering curiosity and lifelong learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Canadian Bioinformatics Hub Atlantic Node</strong> is based at Dalhousie University and covers all of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. This regional team addresses Atlantic Canada&rsquo;s bioinformatics and computational biology needs with a comprehensive training program and community platform built on a foundation of inclusiveness, equity, and diversity. This initiative equips researchers with the skills to manage and analyze large data sets and to make groundbreaking health and environmental discoveries.
