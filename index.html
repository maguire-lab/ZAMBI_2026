    <h2>Welcome to ZAMBI 2026</h2>
    <p>
        The Zoonoses, AMR, and BioInformatics (ZAMBI) meeting brings together cross-disciplinary researchers and trainees working at the intersection of antimicrobial resistance, emerging zoonotic diseases, and computational biology to share their research and develop new cross-cutting One Health skills. This meeting is a joint effort of three CIHR Health Research Training Platforms: <a href="https://canamrnet.org/">CAN-AMR-NET</a>, <a href="https://www.canopytraining.ca/">Canopy</a>, and the <a href="https://bioinformatics.ca/hub/network/atlantic/">Canadian Bioinformatics Hub&rsquo;s Atlantic Node</a>. 
    </p>

    <h2>Meeting Themes</h2>
    The meeting is planned around the following organising themes and designed to be relevant to trainees that directly use these approaches as well as those that do research informed by their associated results:

    <p>
        <strong>Evolution:</strong> Evolutionary theory and analyical approaches (such as phylogenetics/phylodynamics and experimental studies) are central to tracking the change and spread of pathogens and pathogen traits including antimicrobial resistance across interconnected human, animal, and environmental systems.  These analyses underpin One Health approaches by generating actionable evidence for risk assessment and preparedness. They also directly inform policy decisions and multi-sector systems change, enabling more resilient surveillance architectures, targeted interventions, and cross-disciplinary governance.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Environmental Ecology and Microbial Communities:</strong> Field-based environmental sequencing, eDNA, community ecology, and microbiome research are regularly used to characterize the ecological interactions that shape health across human, animal, and environmental systems. These insights guide One Health responses such as microbiome stewardship, informing environmental and public-health policy, and enable systems-level changes that improve ecosystem resilience, surveillance, and resource management.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Experimental and Translational One Health Research:</strong> Applied laboratory and translational research (including on novel therapeutics and vaccines) are key preparedness and response activities to address risks from emerging zoonotic pathogens and growing antimicrobial resistance across the One Health spectrum. This diverse area of research is driven by cross-sector collaboration and also generates key evidence for policy and operational decision-making while incorporating engagement strategies that enhance impact. 
    </p>

    <h2>Our Partner Platforms</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>CAN-AMR-NET</strong> is a national health research training platform focused on antimicrobial use and resistance through a One Health lens. Our goal is to train the next generation of researchers, practitioners, and leaders in the application of transdisciplinary methodologies and communication skills across One Health sectors to tackle the wicked problem of AMR.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Canopy</strong> (Canadian One Health Training Program on Emerging Zoonoses) connects researchers, professionals, and emerging leaders across Canada to tackle health challenges from zoonotic diseases. Canopy is dedicated to training highly competent personnel capable of excellence in health research on emerging zoonoses with a One Health approach, developing a connected community of highly skilled researchers, building sustainable and resilient systems that can better prevent, prepare for, and respond to current and future threats, and fostering curiosity and lifelong learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Canadian Bioinformatics Hub Atlantic Node</strong> is based at Dalhousie University and covers all of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. This regional team addresses Atlantic Canada&rsquo;s bioinformatics and computational biology needs with a comprehensive training program and community platform built on a foundation of inclusiveness, equity, and diversity. This initiative equips researchers with the skills to manage and analyze large data sets and to make groundbreaking health and environmental discoveries.
    </p>
